# Folder Synchronization project

This is a program that synchronizes two folders: source and replica. The program should maintain a full, identical copy of source folder at replica folder. 

- The synchronization is one-way: after the synchronization content of the replica folder should be modified to exactly match content of the source folder;
- The synchronization is performed periodically and the synchronization interval is provided using the command line arguments;
- File creation/copying/removal operations are logged to a file and to the console output ( the log file name is provided using the command line arguments)
